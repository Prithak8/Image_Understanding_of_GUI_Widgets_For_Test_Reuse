# Image_Understanding_of_GUI_Widgets_For_Test_Reuse

- This project attempts to explains how icons, widgets, and images are labeled with
meanings to help match graphical user interface (GUI) events
based on their semantic information.
- We mined relevant data from dataset RICO dataset and used models such as
GLOVE and word2vec to provide foundation for semantic
matching of different events
- We concluded that the combination of semantic matching between GUI events along with widgets/icons slightly but significantly help build a better model for software test reuse
- We made a paper out of this project and successfully presented in IEEE Computer Society affiliated conference
- Later the conference paper was published in IEEE digital library
